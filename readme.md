2. MongoDB


**Bugs of the paper**:

[1] In Table 1, we wrote that Facebook's bug bounty program does not disclose vulnerability reports.
Well after submitting the camera-ready version of the paper, we found out that Facebook maintain a
list of their vulnerability reports disclosed by white hats. So in a sense, Facebook does partially
disclose reports.
